<div>
    <p>
		We have used the 52 week strategy to compare and pick best 5 stocks<br />
		A 52-week high/low is the highest and lowest price that a stock has traded at during the previous year.
		It is a technical indicator used by some traders and investors who view the 52-week high or low as an
		important factor in determining a stock's current value and predicting future price movement. 
		As a stock trades within its 52-week price range (the range that exists between the 52-week low 
		and the 52-week high), these investors may show increased interest as price nears either the high or the low.

        <div>
            To pick top 5 stocks we used this comparing factor:
			(Current stock Price - Lowest stock price in 52 weeks)/(Highest stock price in 52 weeks - Lowest stock price in 52 weeks)
            We calculated this factor for each stock and then compared all the stocks and created a list of 5 stocks with the comparing factor in descending order.
